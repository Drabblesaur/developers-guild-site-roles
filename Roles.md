#### Software Accessibility Advocate
Up until this point, the largest driving force behind desktop computing environments has been Microsoft, first with MS DOS, followed by variants of Microsoft Windows. These operating systems were not designed with the needs of people with disabilities in mind. Many, including those who were blind or physically disabled, were unable to use applications which were written for Microsoft operating systems.
